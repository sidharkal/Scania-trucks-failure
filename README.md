The attribute names of the data have been anonymized for proprietary reasons. It consists of both single numerical counters and histograms consisting of bins with different conditions. Typically the histograms have open-ended conditions at each end. For example, if we measuring the ambient temperature "T" then the histogram could be defined with 4 bins where:

The attributes are as follows: class, then anonymized operational data. The operational data have an identifier and a bin id, like "Identifier_Bin". In total there are 171 attributes, of which 7 are histogram variables. Missing values are denoted by "na".
